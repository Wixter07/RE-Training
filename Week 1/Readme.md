# Week 1

## Initial Setup

These are the basic tools that you'll be working with to learn about RE.

1) Decompiler - [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free) and [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases).
2) Debuggers - Install GDB with `sudo apt install gdb` [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/)
3) Java Decompiler - [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
4) GCC - `sudo apt install gcc`
5) PE Analyzer - [PEBear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear/releases)
   
Python Setup: -

1) pwntools - `pip install pwntools`
2) numpy - `pip install numpy`
3) pycryptodome - `pip install pycryptodome`

Linux Setup: -

1) `sudo apt install strace ltrace`
2) `sudo apt install binutils`
3) `sudo apt install vim-common`

## Tasks

Pretty straight forward. You'll be working with the decompilers and start understanding the language they speak. A very beginner level RE challenges are license checks. So we begin there.

[Reverse Engineering](https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering) section from pwncollege is a good place to begin with. You're expected to finish Level 1.0 - 9.1 this week.
