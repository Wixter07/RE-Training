# Week 3

# Tasks

Well this is going to be an easy week but an important one. We'll learn program flow of binaries using gdb. Week 2 Assembly learning will be best implemented here. Most importantly, you'll learn more about the use of registers in syscalls.

All 8 challs from [Debugging Refresher](https://pwn.college/computing-101/debugging-refresher/) should you get you going with a basic understanding of above.

Additionally, finish all GDB challenges on picoCTF except `Easy as GDB` and all Reverse Egnineering challenges from BITSCTF except `Mishap` along with writeups.
