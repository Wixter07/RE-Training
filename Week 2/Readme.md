# Week 2

# Tasks

You'll learn how to patch instructions. So Level 10.0 - 11.1 from [Reverse Engineering](https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering) should be done. No resources about this will be shared. Find it and learn

The main goal for this week is to learn about Assembly from [Assembly Crash Course](https://pwn.college/computing-101/assembly-crash-course/) module. All 30 challenges should be finished. Write down the purpose of different registers until you're fluent while working with it in future. Assembly is the base of RE, understanding of this will make it easy for us to understand how a binary works in ways a hazy decompilation can't. You should have solve scripts for all 30 challenges.

Since Assembly is the foundation to further improve our understanding about RE, don't compromise in any manner to understand all the stuff. If so however you can't explain your scripts in the meeting, you're **COOKED**
